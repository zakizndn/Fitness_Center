# Fitness Center
ECE3166 - Advanced Microprocessors

Description: 

The application will calculate the total amount payable based on the client's selection of fitness classes and personal training instructor options. Once the client has chosen the classes and services they want, the application will compute the sum payable by adding up the monthly prices of the selected fitness classes and the fee for the chosen personal training instructor option.

For example, if a client selects Pilates (RM160 per month) and Kickboxing (RM200 per month) as their fitness classes, and chooses personal training instructor on a weekly basis (RM900 per week), the application will calculate the sum payable as follows:

Pilates: RM160
Kickboxing: RM200
Personal Training Instructor (Weekly): RM900

Total Payable = RM160 + RM200 + RM900 = RM1260

Additionally, the application will incorporate promotional discounts to encourage clients to enroll in more classes. If a client enrolls in a minimum of 2 classes, they will receive a discount of RM10 on the total amount payable. If they enroll in a minimum of 3 classes, the discount increases to RM20, and for a minimum of 4 classes or more, the discount is RM40.

In addition to the class-based discounts, new clients will receive a discount of RM30 regardless of the number of classes they choose.
By considering the client's selection of classes, personal training instructor option, and applicable discounts, the application will display the final payable amount to the client, ensuring transparency and ease of use in choosing and calculating the desired services.
